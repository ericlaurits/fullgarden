# When was the moment you knew you wanted to stay in education?

I can talk about the first one and, possibly the most powerful. When I was a teacher intern - finishing most of my coursework for my Masters in Education, I was placed at an Arts and Sciences magnet in Northern Virginia. For the first two quarters, I was working in a first grade classroom. In December that year, the school hosted a literacy evening, where we held literacy games, read alouds, skills sessions for parents, mini round table book clubs - for both our K-6 students and their parents. I was running a session for parents on how to read with their children in the evenings, what types of questions to ask, and how to grow your child into a life long reader. Right before the session started, one of my students, Benjamin, ran up to me with his mom and said "Mom, mom, this is Mr. L. He's the one who taught me to read!" 

I totally lost it. I had been working with him intensely those past quarters, with some support from our literacy coach, as he was showing many of the early signs that students eventually diagnosed with dislexia and dysgraphia exhibit.

I could go through every year of my career and highlight the "when I knew I would stay" moments, but this is the first.
