# Teaching is a highly emotional and passionate profession
> Indeed, teaching is a highly emotional, if not passionate, enterprise and this has been a neglected dimension in recent years. William Lodge Paley, a National School teacher in 1824 captures the extent to which feelings are involved: (I am) so teased with teaching that my soul feels heaviness and my spirits dullness. (Mitchell, 1991, p. 32)

This ties in directly to the notion of teachers having an [[Altruism's role in the choice to become a teacher|altruistic]] motive for getting into teaching in the first place. If ongoing teacher PD and encouragement of teacher research is not offered with an emotional/altruistic bent, there is less likelihood of that idea, research, pd, etc. having teacher buy in and enthusiastic support.
