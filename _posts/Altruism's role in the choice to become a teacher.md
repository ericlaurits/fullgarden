# Altruism

Unsurprisingly, the most common reason that preservice teachers give for wanting to get into teaching were based in **altruism**... This can be thought of as a kind of intrinsic motivation but it's also important to think through the relationship between this type of altruistic motivation and a similar motivation used to bring about colonialism. 

> Altruistic motivations were among the most common reasons the teacher candidates identified for wanting to teach... Three themes account for these motivations, including the single most prominent within our analysis: the desire to make a difference for individual children.

#‚ùìquestion Does the altruistic nature of wanting to teach interfere with the need to be culturally responsive with instruction? Is there a hint of colonialism that comes into play here? (Certainly an unconscious bias)

Talk to [[@Betsy Levine Brown]] about this.
