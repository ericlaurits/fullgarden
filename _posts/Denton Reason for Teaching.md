# Denton Reason for Teaching
### [[@Erin Denton]], FCPS teacher responds to questions over text about her reasons for deciding to become a teacher on 2021-02-18. Similar to so many teachers that I have spoken with, her reasons are rooted in [[Altruism's role in the choice to become a teacher | altruism]]

> In brief, what was the reason you got into teaching?

Long story short- I was severely depressed in college. So much so, my dad came to DC to tell me l needed to leave school... bc he was concerned. He asked me to think of the last times I forgot about myself enough to feel happy. All of the memories were with kids.

So, I was studying law... bc I wanted to be a child advocated and switched... bc realized that it was the relationships I had with kids that "filled my cup" So to speak and that I could really make an impact by
helping young people feel seen and to see themselves..

> So why have you made it so many years in this field while so many others burn out?

Changing schools- each time it gave me a boost to get over the hump. And I had to leave the job of classroom teacher to really appreciate the gift you have when you have your own little village

Also... I honestly don't know where the fucking time has gone. I really don't.
