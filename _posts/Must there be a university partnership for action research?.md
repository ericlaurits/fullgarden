# Must there be a university partnership?
> Teacher research refers to the inquiries of K-12 teachers and prospective teachers, often in collaboration with university-based colleagues and other educators. Teacher researchers work in inquiry communities to examine their own assumptions, develop local knowledge by posing questions and gathering data, and in many versions of teacher research work for social justice by using inquiry to assure educational opportunity, access, and equity for all students.

This is an interesting take on the why behind teacher research, the ideas of social justice. What this truly brought to light, however, is an inquiry that is in serious need of an exploration.

 #‚ùìquestion Is it possible for a group of teachers to engage in AR or inquiry based research work without the presence of another professional (be it a coach, resource teacher, university partnership)?

This seems to me to connect strongly to the belief that being a part of a [[PDS]] network. I can't honestly say that I have, in my teaching career, noticed any type of official AR work being done. There is plenty of responsive teaching and informal data analysis being done and while that helps the teacher excel at her craft, it does not take any steps forward in legitimizing the teaching profession as one of serious study and impact, which potentially provides untold benefits, both looking at remuneration as well as standing and status in our American work force.
