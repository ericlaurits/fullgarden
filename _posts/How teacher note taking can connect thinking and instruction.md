# Teacher note taking and connecting their thinking
> I have engaged in the recursive practice of journaling, writing down notes, and collecting artifacts, which provides insights into the learning practices of my students. Then, I interpret these practices as I plan my next class. I engage in a formative process that informs each class and in a summative process—a meta-analysis—that informs the revision of the course as a whole. Often, this kind of research is referred to as “self-study” in teacher education.

This is not a self-study. This is clearly the formalized collection and analysis of data - the large difference here is there is no mention of looking at the existing research in the field, which must be a part of the research process. 

This is also a great argument for the incredible benefits of collecting and analyzing student data in a link based system where teachers can cross reference students with their learning outcomes and be searching for trends and commonalities that can be addresses with responsive instruction.
