# How teachers are treated by the public at large
> knowledge are, at best, underestimated, and at worst, disregarded – by parents and the general public, by politicians, by the children and, curiously, by many teachers themselves. A further downgrading of an already poorly regarded workforce has been particularly in evidence over the past 10 years when there has been a sustained period of political and public criticism of teachers.

## Other professions that do research are considered superior
> Professionals who are able to integrate research with practice – e.g. doctors, educational psychologists, architects, management consultants – do not find themselves on such shaky theoretical ground. They are seen as possessing a body of knowledge that is not easily acquired by others and, generally speaking, they are held in some regard by the public. In contrast, there is a lack of agreement about the knowledge needed for teaching and a “yawning gap between theory and practice” (Hargreaves, 1996, p. 2). Teaching children (particularly primary aged children) is something that many people feel they can do without any professional training or experience.
