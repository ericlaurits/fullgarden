# Teacher Action Research, Simply

When we write and discuss the ideas of teacher research, we often find ourselves defaulting to highly academic language, steeped in citing research and utilizing as many three syllable + words that we can. This feeds into this idea of us trying to "keep up with the Jonses" of scientific research. There is no way for us to win the fight for legitimacy by trying to get as close as we can to scientific research. Scientific research will always be better at scientific research. As I see it, the path forward is the building of both in school and community culture around the *sharing* of our research complete with contextual identifiers in place and highlighting the importance why this research needs to be grounded in qualitative data and why that is every bit as valid as quantitative data - possibly even more so because of the intimate knowledge of the teachers that are working, daily, with the teachers.

#‚ùìquestion What are the main argument points both for and against qualitative data in the "scientific" fields? How do we argue against that in the education world?
