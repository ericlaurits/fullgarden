# Defining what holding an "inquiry stance" means
> According to Ravitch (2014), holding inquiry as stance involves three elements: (1) developing and refining understanding of reflection and its role, (2) viewing inquiry as an everyday ethic, and (3) viewing inquiry as central to our professional vision.

> The findings in this study demonstrate that teachers who engage in a continuous cycle of asking questions and seeking answers hold an inquiry stance.

So this might suggest that the major gap between holding an inquiry stance and more formalized AR is the consultation of prior research? 

#‚ùìquestion What if that prior research was prior teacher knowledge?
