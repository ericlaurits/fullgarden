# Frame
_Framing is the part of the [[NNFFr]] [[Action Research]] process that puts our data in context of our current classroom and it maps on to what is traditionally thought of as the observe stage in action research._ ^49dee1

Within this stage we find the biggest difference between action research and scientific research. Action research is designed to be responsive, nimble, and constantly tweaked and adjusted as it **requires** the researcher to conduct their process in the context of their current classroom. Classrooms vary across schools, counties, states, countries, etc. as action researchers we are specifically interested in the immediacy of the present moment. We're not quite as concerned with large developmental global trends, large _n_, sample groups and many of the more formal aspects of scientific research. AR is all about inquiry and context. Effective, responsive instruction **must** always be bound by context.

Framing also implies that we're examining all our ideas within the context of existing literature on the topic. Of all the struggles continuing to challenge my desire to simplify the understanding and path of action research, incorporating and examining prior data is one of the most difficult.

#‚ùìquestion 
If we offer the conceit that more often than not there is a required partnership between a research professional and the classroom teacher (this could take the form of an embedded grant position, university faculty, doctoral student, resource teacher), this person is responsible for producing, consuming, digesting, and relaying the existing literature and distilling it for the partner teacher. This connects to thoughts from [[Must there be a university partnership for action research?]]
