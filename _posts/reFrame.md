# reFrame

_Reframing is the ever important reflective piece of the process that technically, occurs throughout the [[NNFFr]] [[Action Research]] cycle. It can lead to the next steps of instruction or encourage us to reinterpret what we're seeing, our action plan, our analysis of the data or revisit our implementation._

Ask yourself two questions
- what changed today in their learning?
- whose perspective am I missing?

Building a ritual
- Same time, same place every day
- write (dictate) them somewhere
- Use them to inform your next steps
- (lean and nimble!)
