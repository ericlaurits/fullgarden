# Notice

*Notice is the primary component of the [[NNFFr]] [[Action Research]]framework for action research and where the process begins. Just like assessment drives instruction, inquiry drives your assessment and leads into the [[action research]] cycle*

Noticing your students within this framework will typically take one of two approaches: formal or informal assessment. More formalized assessments can be thought of as entrance and exit tickets, one on one interviews/check-ins, etc. Noticing being thought of as more informal could be the observational analysis of students, classroom, and available anecdotal data and is the prerequisite/precursor to the "teacher's intuition" that leads to the naming of the need. This can be mapped directly on to the planning stage of AR.


## What are we looking for?

When we notice, we're looking for a trend or a commonality. Something that seems to either present the beginning stages of a pattern (possibly it's cyclical in nature) or that is an unexpected outcome based on events that have transpired in the classroom. These noticing maybe social, emotional, or academic in nature (and many times may contain elements of each).


## Methods of approach

- informal
	-	anecdotal notes
	-	generalized or targeted observations
	-	observational analysis of students, classroom, and available anecdotal data
- formal
	-	pre/post assessment
	-	systematic data collection necessary for BIP, IEP, etc.
	-	entrance/exit tickets
	-	interviews/check-ins

When we notice, we [[name]].
