# What is your subject area strength?

I have always liked to think of myself as a little bit of a jack of all trades, and I think most educators that go into elementary education do, but probably the areas I am most passionate about are literacy and in particular how we communicate with others.

Much of my **action research** has been centered around prosody and how we might combat combat the assumptions that others make about a student's intelligence based on what they sound like when they read or speak.

All that being said, my last position was centered around PBL coaching and development, and running our STEAM lab, for which I developed the entire curriculum, and I have degrees and a background in both fine and performative arts.

But truly, I am addicted to growing readers and writers. I love conferencing with readers and writers, facilitating book clubs, working with our pre-readers with letter names and sounds... I was always that teacher that others would send their students to and ask, "Can you send him back addicted to books?"
