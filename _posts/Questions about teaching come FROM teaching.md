# In AR, questions come out of the practice of teaching and why we do it
> In practitioner research, questions emerge from practice and then practitioners design research studies to collect and analyze practice-based data that respond to these questions within their organizational or communal contexts. Practitioner research is undertaken by practitioners who seek to improve our own practice, and perhaps that of our colleagues, through the purposeful and critical examination of and reflection on aspects of our work, of the experiences of our colleagues and constituencies, and of institutional cultures, policies, and practices that shape these realities.

This thinking about AR hits all the main points - context, the idea that questions emerge from practice. That is an under-discussed aspect of AR is that the questions are truly derived from the practice of teaching. This could be another differentiator between scientific research and AR, looking into where these questions initiate from.

Secondly, this begins to address the [[Altruism's role in the choice to become a teacher | altruistic]] ties into the teaching profession. Admittedly, I have never engaged in AR because I though it would make me a better teacher, I was always just curious. 

#❓question I wonder what the percentage of teachers who engage in AR think about it as a way to improve their craft vs. something that they do because they maintain an inquiry mindset?

To really make AR something that happens, it HAS to tie in to a teacher's motives for teaching and compliment the internal joy/rewards that they get from their day in and day out of teaching.

For example, if a teacher thrives on getting those "Ah-Ha!" Moments out of kids, AR can be pitched as a way to increase the volume of those AhHa moments or even a path to systematic AhHa generation. I would think This can be looked at though any teacher motivation lens and thought about as a path towards a more rewarding teaching experience. 

It's not something else you need to do on top of what you're already doing, it's actually something that lightens your load and allows you to focus on what's important and not get distracted by the mundane. 

#❓question Is it a focus tool? Can it be done in conjunction with linking/data collection?
