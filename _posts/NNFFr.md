# Notice Name Frame Follow and reFrame

_This is a framework (also referred to as NNFFr) that I developed in 2019 while doing action research and co-teaching 5th grade math at Daniels Run Elementary with [[@Ingy Rucker]]. It was first [presented](https://prezi.com/view/RyFpGYA7ijbgUyLsE8O6/) at George Mason University's TIPS night where we were the featured keynote speakers and presented our own action research._

The framework was designed as both a tool for universities to simplify how [[action research]] is taught to pre-service teachers as well as  a tool for practicing teachers to structure their research, planning, and implementation of responsive instruction. Teachers continue to be reluctant to engage as researchers, yet in most other professions that require advanced schooling (medical doctor, psychologist, scientists, etc.) research is an expected and welcomed part of the profession and lends credence and respect to the job [[Research lends legitimacy]]

The traditionally established procedure for action research, plan, act, observe, reflect, can be directly mapped on to this framework for professors and teachers looking to hybridize their approach to utilizing the NNFFr framework.

## Notice

[[Notice]] is the observational analysis of students, classroom, and available data and is the prerequisite/precursor to the "teacher's hunch" that leads to the naming of the need. This can be mapped directly on to the planning stage of AR.


## Name

[[Name]] Naming is also part of the planning stage - identifying an area of focus for the research/responsive instruction.


## Frame

To [[Frame]] puts our data in context of the current classroom in front of us and it maps on to what is traditionally thought of as the observe stage in action research. This is the biggest distinction between action research and scientific research. Framing also implies that we're framing our ideas within the context of existing literature on the topic. Of all the struggles continuing to challenge my desire to simplify the understanding and path of action research, incorporating and examining prior data is one of the most difficult.


## Follow

When we [[Follow]] our data, it provides us with a clear path towards our next instructional move. Analyze and interpret.


## reFrame

The [[reFrame]] is the ever important reflective piece of the process that technically, occurs throughout the cycle. It can lead to the next steps of instruction or encourage us to reinterpret what we're seeing, our action plan, our analysis of the data or revisit our implementation.
