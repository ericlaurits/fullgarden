First and foremost a coach is a leader, specifically in this instance a teacher-leader.

I see the role of a coach having four main components - as a 
1. **resource for teachers**, whether it is providing personalized profesional development or even just as a bank of ideas for problemsolving in the classroom. 
2. Secondly, , as an **analyst of data**, whether that data is self collected or provided.
3. Thirdly a **pedagological expert**, someone who can come in and model or guide at the drop of a hat, and the
4. fourth as a bit of a **sounding board**, someone to bounce ideas off of whether it is to solve a connundrum in the classroom or  and analyst, teacher/modeler, 

The three biggest things that a coach must have are pedagolocical knowledge, content area expertice, and intrapersonal nuance.

Personalized professional development

Teacher leaders who work alongside teachers to provide support but not in an administrative or supervisory role. The instructional coach is there to work alongside teachers to provide resources and skills to help improve your performance in the classroom

Set aside significant portion of their time to offer classroom modeling, supportive feedback, and specific observations of individual teaching practices.

Shoulder to shoulder with teachers respectfully share teaching strategies and paths to craft refinement.

A coach is someone who can examine, analyze, and then give feedback and support without causing resentment.

Don't complicate something simple

>For the purposes of this discussion, an instructional coach is defined as someone whose primary professional responsibility is to bring ractices that have been studied using a variety of research methods into classrooms by working with adults rather than students. Instructional coaches, as described here, may spend some time working with groups of teachers and may have other administrative responsibilities, but they set aside a significant portion of their time to offer classroom modeling, supportive feedback, and specific observations of individual teaching practices.

>-   **Pedagogical knowledge**. The literature is nearly unanimous that coaches should be experienced teachers who have demonstrated success in the classroom. Effective coaches have a thorough understanding of how children learn and are skilled in developing and implementing instructional strategies — from questioning strategies to classroom management — to improve student learning. These accomplished teachers not only have a larger toolbox of instructional strategies to draw upon; according to teacher surveys, they also are more likely to earn teachers' trust.

>-   **Content expertise**. Effective instructional coaches, no matter their subject area, have a thorough understanding of the subject they are coaching as well as familiarity with the curriculum that teachers are currently using.9 This is particularly important for coaches who focus on a subject area such as literacy or mathematics or who work at the middle or high school level, because of the demand for in-depth understanding of the complexities of the content area at higher grade levels.10 Process-oriented coaches whose task is to improve classroom strategies such as data analysis or differentiated instruction must also have experience in and a deep understanding of these critical instructional strategies and methods.
> 
>- **Interpersonal capabilities**. The existing research on effective coaches makes clear that along with content and pedagogical expertise, coaches must possess strong interpersonal skills and competencies.11 In a 2003 survey of 31 professional development coaches, the most frequently mentioned characteristic of an effective coach was "people skills," including the ability to build relationships, establish trust and credibility, and tailor assistance to individual educators' needs.12 Researchers at the Center for Research on Learning at the University of Kansas have similarly found that successful coaches possess not only strong content knowledge but also an "infectious personality" that helps them encourage and inspire teachers to improve their practices.13 Coaches themselves ranked interpersonal capabilities higher in importance than content and pedagogical knowledge; they believed they could improve their content expertise through training but people skills would be more difficult to acquire.

>Instructional coaches are educational leaders that train teachers and provide resources, feedback, modeling, and [professional development](https://www.graduateprogram.org/2020/02/implementing-instructional-leadership-pd-through-coaching/) to help schools meet instructional goals and school improvement goals. They should have a significant amount of teaching experience and knowledge. Coaching is an avenue that can provide teachers with the support they need by embedding professional development into the coaching process. In essence, instructional coaching is just what it sounds like, coaching teachers in the area of teaching.
