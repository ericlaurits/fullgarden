# Teacher friendly forms of [[Action Research]]

> Pollard & Tann (1987, p. 23) believe that “critical reflection and systematic investigation” of teaching practice should be an integral part of classroom life. Such writers have recommended ‘teacher friendly’ forms of research like self-evaluation, reflection, action research, action enquiry, and case study. And, as indicated at the beginning of this paper, many teachers have successfully researched educational issues using these approaches.

This is exactly the same reason that I began to work on [[NNFFr]], though what is suggested here is missing the pieces of AR that make it AR. While the process and procedure is similar, it misses a few key points that I would like to address.
- There is no mention or prior research
- legitimizing the teaching profession - (see: [[There is a stigma around big R and little r research]])
- publishing/learning from colleagues - where is the sharing of this information? Perhaps a more formalized structure during a symposium or CLT where we share our ideas.


#❓question could this be built into the formation of a SMARTr goal if the school has that system implemented?
